# Angular-POC

This POC implements some concepts in order to show a basic idea of some elements. 

It's a Single Page Application using generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1. 

Some elements are: template-driven forms, some third-party controls, bootstrap 4, SCSS Themes, Data Export , DragDrop, Log Service, and more.

## Installing Angular CLI

Install the CLI using the [npm package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). From you Terminal, Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Packages Installation

From you Terminal, inside this project folder, Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
